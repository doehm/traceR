# traceR <img src='dev/images/hex.png' align="right" height="240" />

`traceR` allows you to click on an image in the plot window (kind of like a join the dots picture) and record the coordinates into a data frame. They can then be plotted independently in a ggplot. 

This enables the user to plot custom shapes in R without having to manually enter the coordinates into a data frame.

## Installation

Install from Github:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("doehm/traceR")
```

## Usage

### TL;DR

To use `trace_image`:

1. Plot an image or any `ggplot`
2. Run `df <- trace_image()`
3. Click on the desired coordinates in the required sequence
4. When finished click on the left side of the plot window between 0 and `stop_window` pixels on the x-axis

The coordinates are scaled to (0, 1) by default and returned as a `tibble`. There is an
option to return the raw pixel coordinates.

## Example
